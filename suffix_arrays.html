      A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_array">suffix array</a> is
      a sorted list of all the suffixes of a string.
      All string comparisons are done lexicographically, so compare the first
      characters, and if they're equal go to the next character.
      Instead of storing the entire suffix as a sequence of characters, we store
      just the beginning index.
      This is useful when looking for all the occurrences of a substring, since
      all suffixes beginning with the substring end up next to each other in the
      suffix array, and we can binary search to find them.

String: "bcababacc"
Suffix array: 9 2 4 6 3 5 0 8 1 7
                a a a b b b c c c
              ^ b b c a a c   a c
              e a a c b c a   b
              m b c   a c b   a
              p a c   c   a   b
              t c     c   b   a
              y c         a   c
                          c   c
              v           c

      There are more applications of suffix arrays, but I'm going to write about
      the construction of suffix arrays, specifically the SA-IS algorithm, and
      how my awful implementation works.
    </p>
    <p>
      I read through <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs166/
      cs166.1196/lectures/04/Small04.pdf">this set of stanford lecture notes</a>
      a whole bunch of times until I think I can finally say that I understand
      what's going on, and hopefully I can explain it well.

      To begin, we want to have a sentinel character at the end of the string.
      It makes life easier later on.
      The sentinel is defined to be the smallest character, and it is unique.
      We'll use <code>'$'</code> for this string since its ASCII value
      <code>0x24</code> is smaller than all the alphanumeric characters, it
      happens to be the regex end of line character, and it's what's used in the
      original SA-IS paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      We assign types to the suffixes, where a suffix can be either S-type or
      L-type.
      A suffix starting at index <code>i</code> is S-type if it is the sentinel
      or it is smaller than the suffix starting at index <code>i + 1</code>.
      A suffix starting at index <code>i</code> is L-type if it is larger than
      the suffix starting at index <code>i + 1</code>.
      We want to build up an array <code>types</code> storing the type of each
      suffix.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's look at a way of implementing the function <code>is_l_type</code>
      <pre>
bool is_l_type(char *str, int i) {
  if (str[i] == '$') return false;
  if (str[i] &lt; str[i + 1]) return false;
  if (str[i] &gt; str[i + 1]) return true;
  return is_l_type(str, i + 1);
}
      </pre>
      If we run <code>types[i] = is_l_type(str, i)</code> for each index i,
      we'd have O(n^2).
      But notice that <code>is_l_type(str, i)</code> depends on the output of
      <code>is_l_type(str, i + 1)</code>.
      If we store <code>types[i + 1] = is_l_type(str, i + 1)</code>, then when
      calculating <code>is_l_type(str, i)</code>, we already have the result
      of <code>is_l_type(str, index + 1)</code> stored in
      <code>types[i + 1]</code>.
      So we can begin at the end of the array, starting with the sentinel as
      S-type, and iterate backwards to get all the types in O(n).

      This is example of dynamic programming, a pretty simple
      example but an example none the less.
    </p>
    <pre>
String: "bcababacc$"
Types:   SLSLSLSLLS
  1   3   5   7
 S L S L S L S L
0   2   4   6   8
                 L
                  9
    </pre>
    <p>
      Now that we have the types of the suffixes, we pick out Left-Most-S-type
      (LMS) suffixes, which are S-type suffixes that are preceded by an L-type
      suffix.
    </p>
    <pre>
  1   3   5   7
 S L S L S L S L
0   2   4   6   8
    ^   ^   ^    L
                  9
                  ^
    </pre>

      What's cool about these suffixes is that if we have them sorted, then we
      can figure out the order of the rest of the suffixes in O(n) time.
      This procedure is called an Induced Sort: that's what the "IS" in the
      algorithm name refers to.
      It works by something similar to a bucket sort/k-way merge.
    </p>
    <p>
      What's also cool is that every time I try to explain this part of the
      algorithm, I confuse myself and anyone trying to listen along.
      So for now this is approximately where this article is going to trail off.
      Maybe some another time, I'll come back to writing this.
    </p>
    <p>
      We begin by inducing the order of the L-type suffixes:
      <pre>
  _   _   _   _
 |1\ |3\ |5\ |7\
 S\L\S\L\S\L\S\L\
0  \2| \4| \6| \8\
    ^   ^   ^   \L\
                 \9|
                  ^
      </pre>
      We start with all the lists we want to merge in a priority queue:
      <pre>
String: bcababacc$
7&#62;8&gt;9: $
 &#32;1&gt;2: ababacc$
 &#32;3&gt;4: abacc$
 &#32;5&gt;6: acc$
Suffix array: []
      </pre>
      We take list with the smallest suffix, and append it to the suffix array.
      Then, we get the next suffix in the list, and put it back into the
      priority queue.
