      Yield in C++11
    </h1>
    <h2>
      A hacky trick you can pull with mutable lambdas and switch statements.
    </h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Python has the <code>yield</code> keyword for making generators.
      C++23 has <code>std::generator</code>, but at the time I'm writing this,
      no compilers support it.
      And even when compilers do start supporting it, it'll take some time for
      projects to update to a newer standard.
    </p>
    <h2>What do we need for a generator?</h2>
    <p>
      What we're looking for in a generator is to be able to yield a value from
      within a function, suspend execution of the function, and resume it later.
      This means we need our position in the function and our local variables to
      remain unchanged between the suspension and resuming of the function.
    </p>
    <h2>Lambda function copy captures.</h2>
    <p>
      Copy caputures of a lambda function will give us variables that will keep
      their values as long as the function object is alive, so we can replace
      all of our local variables with these.
      In order to be able to modify the values of the copy captures, we need to
      specify that our lambda is <code>mutable</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To differentiate between yielding a value versus the generator finishing,
      returning an <code>std::optional</code> would probably be the most
      readable &ndash; the generator either yields a value, or it doesn't.
      However, <code>std::optional</code> is a feature of C++17, so we can
      instead hack our way around it with pointers.
      We can have the variable we want to return as another copy capture so it
      won't be destroyed, and return a pointer to it.
      We can return a <code>nullptr</code> to signify that we're done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, we need to be able to save and resume our position in the code.
      We can have another copy capture be our &ldquo;instruction pointer&rdquo;,
      but how do we jump back to our saved position upon resuming the generator?
      We need some sort of multi-way conditional jump...
    </p>
    <h2>Switch statement shenanigans.</h2>
    <p>
      In C-like languages, <code>case</code> labels are just that: labels, like
      the kind you see in assembly.
      That's why most typical uses of switch statements will come with a
      <code>break</code> at the end of each case &ndash; otherwise, execution
      will fallthrough to the next case.
      But here, we'll abuse this fallthrough functionality in a style similar to
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device">Duff's device</a>
      for jumping back to a saved position.
    </p>
    <h2>Putting it all together.</h2>
    <p>
      There is a fibonacci sequence generator on
      <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/coroutines">cppreference's page on coroutines</a>,
      so I took that code and re-implemented it using the techniques discussed
      above.
    </p>
    <pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;functional&gt;

std::function&lt;std::uint64_t*()&gt; fibonacci_sequence(unsigned n) {
  int ip = 0;
  std::uint64_t a, b, s;
  unsigned i;
  return [=]() mutable -&gt; std::uint64_t* { switch (ip) { case 0:
    if (n == 0)
      return nullptr;

    if (n &gt; 94)
      throw std::runtime_error("Too big Fibonacci sequence. Elements would overflow.");

    ip = 1; return &amp;(s = 0); case 1: ;

    if (n == 1)
      return nullptr;

    ip = 2; return &amp;(s = 1); case 2: ;

    if (n == 2)
      return nullptr;

    a = 0;
    b = 1;
    for (i = 2; i &lt; n; i++) {
      s = a + b;
      ip = 3; return &s; case 3: ;
      a = b;
      b = s;
    }
    default: return nullptr;
  }};
}

int main() {
  auto gen = fibonacci_sequence(10);
  for (int j = 0; auto gen_val = gen(); j++) {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "fib(" &lt;&lt; j &lt;&lt; ")=" &lt;&lt; *gen_val &lt;&lt; '\n';
  }
}
    </pre>
    <p>
      And after no complaints during compilation:
    </p>
    <pre>
$ g++ cpp11_yield.cpp -std=gnu++11
$ ./a
fib(0)=0
fib(1)=1
fib(2)=1
fib(3)=2
fib(4)=3
fib(5)=5
fib(6)=8
fib(7)=13
fib(8)=21
fib(9)=34
    </pre>
